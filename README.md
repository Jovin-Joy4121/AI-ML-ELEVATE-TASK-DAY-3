# 🏠 Linear Regression - Housing Price Prediction

This project is part of the AI & ML Internship - **Task 3**: Linear Regression. The objective is to implement and understand both simple and multiple linear regression using the Housing Price Prediction dataset.

## 📌 Task Objectives

- Import and preprocess the dataset
- Perform train-test split
- Fit a Linear Regression model using `sklearn.linear_model`
- Evaluate using MAE, MSE, R² Score
- Visualize the regression performance
- Interpret model coefficients

---

## 📊 Dataset

**Source**: [Kaggle - Housing Price Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/housing-price-prediction)

**File Used**: `Housing.csv`

Make sure to upload the dataset manually to your Google Colab environment or configure the Kaggle API if automating downloads.
